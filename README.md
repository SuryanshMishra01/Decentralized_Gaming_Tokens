This solidity smart contract 'DegenGamingERC20_Token' is created for a (hypothetical) gaming studio - Degen Gaming where this program will create 'DGN' tokens which can be earned by players in their game and then redeemed for rewards in their in-game stores.
Note: The contract 'myGameAssets' is used here to create in game NFTS which can be exchanged for DGN tokens. This contract is already imprted in the 'DegenGamingERC20_Token' contract, so deploy that contract only.
